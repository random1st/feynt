/// Detects a model that has started emitting nothing but whitespace where the
/// grammar permits any amount of it.
///
/// JSON allows unbounded whitespace between tokens, so a constrained decode can
/// spin: after `{` the automaton accepts spaces, tabs and newlines forever, and
/// a model whose preferred continuation is masked may keep sampling them until
/// `max_tokens` — a 200 with an empty, truncated document (seen on a real
/// checkpoint: `{\n  \t\n  \t\n …`). Once `threshold` consecutive sampled
/// tokens were whitespace-only, ``isActive`` latches on for the rest of the
/// generation and the constraint processor withholds whitespace-only tokens at
/// structural positions (never inside a string, where spaces are data). The
/// latch does not reset: a model that got here has shown a pathological
/// preference, and releasing it would let it alternate between whitespace runs
/// and forced structural tokens, burning the budget just as surely (the same
/// rule as mlx-swift-lm's `WhitespaceRunTracker`).
