/// A compiled object schema at any depth of the supported JSON-schema subset
/// (Track C — C2): the root of a `response_format` schema when that root is an
/// object, or an object anywhere below it (``SchemaValueType/object(_:)``).
///
/// Produced by ``ResponseFormatDecoder`` from an OpenAI
/// `response_format: {"type":"json_schema", …}` body, and consumed at decode
/// time by ``SchemaConstraintState`` to constrain generation to an object that:
///
///  - opens with `{` and closes with `}`;
///  - contains only keys drawn from ``properties`` (no additional keys);
///  - contains each key at most once;
///  - contains every name in ``required``; and
///  - gives each present key a value of its declared ``SchemaValueType``.
///
/// Keys may appear in any order (JSON objects are unordered), so the runtime
/// automaton tracks the set of already-emitted keys of each open object rather
/// than a fixed sequence. A key may be any string: on the wire the model spells
/// a scalar outside ASCII raw or as a JSON escape, the quote, the backslash and
/// control characters as an escape, and the rest raw (see `LiteralMatch`).
